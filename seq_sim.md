NAND Command Sequence Generator & Model Learner

🌐 Project Overview

This project aims to simulate and learn NAND flash memory operation sequences using deep learning. The key motivation is to generate realistic and valid command sequences (Erase, Program, Read) that reflect real-world NAND firmware behaviors and eventually build a generative model that mimics valid and diverse access patterns.

✅ Objective

Generate valid and diverse NAND command sequences.

Learn the behavioral patterns of NAND command usage.

Build a deep learning model capable of generating realistic, scenario-driven command sequences.

Enable model-based evaluation of firmware logic, robustness, and edge-case simulation.

🪡 Key Challenges

NAND commands have strict validity rules (e.g., erase must precede program; program must occur in page order).

The ground truth for command order is not unique; multiple valid command flows exist.

Simple text-based models are insufficient due to structured address fields and execution constraints.

Components

ScenarioGenerator:

Generates synthetic sequences respecting NAND constraints.

Includes stateful tracking of blocks and pages.

Supports scenario-aware generation (GC loop, sequential write, random read).

ScenarioValidator:

Rule-based checker for command validity.

Ensures sequences conform to NAND protocol (e.g., program only after erase, sequential page order).

ScenarioClassifier:

Classifies sequences into high-level patterns: sequential write, hot-block loop, GC, etc.

Used for scenario-level accuracy evaluation.

Deep Learning Model (to be trained):

Input: Tokenized sequences (command + normalized address).

Architecture: Lightweight Transformer or GRU-based autoregressive model.

Output: Next command + address prediction.

Objective: Maximize likelihood for valid next-step predictions under sequence constraints.

Visualization Tools:

3D scatter plots of command accesses over time.

Heatmaps of block/page utilization.

Scenario difference comparison between ground truth and model output.
